Beautiful Soup 3.2.x series
***************************

This is the 'stable' series of Beautiful Soup. It will have only
occasional bugfix releases. It will not work with alternate parsers or
with Python 3.0. If you need these things, you'll need to use the 3.1
series.

3.2.0
=====

Gave the stable series a higher version number than the unstable
series, to make it very clear which series most people should be using.

When creating a Tag object, you can specify its attributes as a dict
rather than as a list of 2-tuples.

3.0.8.1
=======

Bug fixes
---------

Corrected Beautiful Soup's behavior when a findAll() call contained a
value for the "text" argument as well as values for arguments that
imply it should search for tags. (The "text" argument takes priority
and text is returned, not tags.)

Corrected a typo that made I_CANT_BELIEVE_THEYRE_NESTABLE_BLOCK_TAGS
stop being a tuple.

3.0.8
=====

Inauguration of the 3.0.x series as the stable series.

New features
------------

Tag.replaceWithChildren()
  Replace a tag with its children.

Tag.string assignment
 `tag.string = string` replaces the contents of a tag with `string`.

Tag.text property (NOT A FUNCTION!)
 tag.text gathers together and joins all text children. Much faster than
 "".join(tag.findAll(text=True))

Tag.getText(seperator=u"")
 Same as Tag.text, but a function that allows a custom seperator between joined
 text elements.

Tag.index(element) -> int
 Returns the index of `element` within the tag. Matches the actual
 element instead of using __eq__.

Tag.clear()
 Remove all child elements.

Improvements
------------

Previously, searching by CSS class only matched tags that had the
requested CSS class and no other classes. Now, searching by CSS class
matches every tag that uses that class.

Performance
-----------

Beware! Although searching the tree is much faster in 3.0.8 than in
previous versions, you probably won't notice the difference in real
situations, because the time spent searching the tree is typically
dwarfed by the time spent parsing the file in the first place.

Tag.decompose() is several times faster.
A very basic findAll(...) is several times faster.
findAll(True) is special cased
Tag.recursiveChildGenerator is much faster
